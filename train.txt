The most common levels of normalization are the first normal form (1NF), second normal form (2NF), and third normal form (3NF). Each level introduces rules to ensure that data is logically stored.'}, {'question': 'How do you optimize a database query?', 'answer': 'To optimize a database query, I analyze the execution plan to identify bottlenecks, use indexes on frequently searched columns, avoid unnecessary columns in SELECT statements, and use joins efficiently instead of subqueries. Additionally, caching frequent queries can also improve performance.'}, {'question': 'What is a REST API, and how does it work?', 'answer': 'A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a set of rules and standards for creating web services. It works by using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the necessary information for the server to fulfill that request.'}, {'question': 'Explain the concept of multithreading.', 'answer': 'Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a program, enabling parallel execution. It is useful for performing multiple tasks at the same time, like handling multiple requests in a web server. In Python, the threading library is commonly used for this purpose.'}, {'question': 'What is a linked list, and how does it differ from an array?', 'answer': 'A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, with each node pointing to the next one. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. This makes linked lists more flexible for dynamic data operations, but accessing elements is slower compared to arrays due to the need to traverse the list.'}]}, {'category': 'Situational', 'questions': [{'question': 'How would you handle a situation where a project deadline is at risk?', 'answer': 'If a project deadline is at risk, I would first assess the situation to understand what caused the delay.
